# Welcom to Divy

Divy is a financial app that allows users to split transactions in real-time. Imagine you're at a restaurant with three friends and one forgets their wallet (this happens ALL the time of course). No problem! Just create a Divy transaction, add all parties and we'll take care of the financials for you. 

In order to use Divy, we'll need you to connect a bank account OR use Divy Dollars (purchasable upon login) to process transactions with other users.

There's multiple ways to conduct transactions:

1. Split a bill in real-time
2. Charge friends for previous transactions
3. Divy to friends if you owe money for anything else

Another great feature of Divy is the ability to create groups. Each user in a group will receive a Divy card (which is also available for personal use) and can complete transactions so long as the group authorizes the spend.
